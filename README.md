# AI for Chess · ChessExplain

ChessExplain is a full-stack chess analysis and white-box search lab with an
interactive React/TypeScript interface and a FastAPI backend. It combines a
Stockfish-backed analysis board with a Search Lab for comparing Alpha-Beta and
MCTS search behavior.

The active application is in `phase2_research/`.

## What Works Now

- Analysis page: play through a position, fetch opening-book moves, analyze
  moves, and review PGNs.
- Search Lab: import the current FEN, edit positions, choose Alpha-Beta or
  MCTS, inspect candidates and search trees.
- Local mode: Vite frontend plus FastAPI backend.
- Production mode: Cloudflare Pages frontend under `/chess/` plus Railway
  backend.
- Opening book: backend calls Lichess Opening Explorer directly with
  `LICHESS_API_TOKEN` or `LICHESS_TOKEN`.

Removed legacy clutter: the old root-level Phase 1 frontend, Cloudflare Worker
opening-book proxy, generated benchmark plots/CSV, and local agent/plugin
scaffolding are no longer part of the tracked project.

## Local Development

### Backend

```powershell
cd C:\Users\15096\Desktop\ChessExplain\phase2_research\backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Health check:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

### Frontend

Open a second terminal:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\15096\Desktop\ChessExplain\phase2_research\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use these URLs:

- Analysis page: `http://localhost:5173/analyze`
- Search Lab: `http://localhost:5173/search-lab`
- Deployment health: `http://localhost:5173/health`

On Windows, prefer `localhost:5173` for Vite. Depending on how Vite binds IPv6,
`127.0.0.1:5173` may not respond.

## Environment Variables

Backend `.env` example:

```env
LICHESS_API_TOKEN=lip_xxxxxx
```

`LICHESS_TOKEN` is also accepted for compatibility.

Production frontend build uses:

```env
VITE_API_BASE=https://ai-for-chess-production.up.railway.app
VITE_APP_BASE=/chess
```

## Verification

Backend:

```powershell
cd phase2_research/backend
python -m pytest tests -q
python scripts/deployment_smoke.py --api-base http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The smoke command expects the backend server to be running.

Frontend:

```powershell
cd phase2_research/frontend
npm test -- --run
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Backend: Railway

Railway is configured from the repository root with:

```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[service]
rootDirectory = "phase2_research/backend"
```

The backend process is defined by `phase2_research/backend/Procfile`:

```text
web: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}
```

Set `LICHESS_API_TOKEN` in Railway variables for opening-book support.

### Frontend: Cloudflare Pages

Build the frontend:

```powershell
cd phase2_research/frontend
npm run build
```

Copy `phase2_research/frontend/dist/` into the blog repository at:

```text
E:\计算机\wangzhai-blog\my-blog\public\chess
```

The deployed routes are:

- `https://thu-wangzhai.pages.dev/chess/`
- `https://thu-wangzhai.pages.dev/chess/analyze/`
- `https://thu-wangzhai.pages.dev/chess/search-lab/`
- `https://thu-wangzhai.pages.dev/chess/health/`

## Project Notes

- API contract: see `docs/api-contract.md`.
- Score semantics: see `docs/scoring.md`. Scores are white-centric: positive
  means White is better, negative means Black is better.
- Analysis page diagnosis: see `docs/analysis-diagnostics.md`.
- Search Lab behavior: see `docs/search-lab.md`.
- Deployment smoke checks: see `docs/deployment-smoke-checks.md`.
- Keep frontend internal navigation on React Router `Link`/`NavLink`, not raw
  root-relative `<a href="/...">`, because production is mounted under `/chess`.
- Keep opening-book calls in the backend. The old Cloudflare Worker proxy has
  been retired.
- Generated outputs such as `dist/`, `node_modules/`, virtualenvs, benchmark
  result CSVs, plots, and local agent state should stay out of git.
